# freevhdl

 freevhdl is an open source project aimed at collecting a wide range of modules commonly used in hardware design. This repository gathers various open source VHDL code snippets and reusable components, providing a centralized resource for designers and developers working with VHDL.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the collection to help grow this shared resource.
